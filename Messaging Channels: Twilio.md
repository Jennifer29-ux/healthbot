 On our comptures
We unzip the downloaded zip file
  by double clicking (Windows in RasaProjct folder)
  unzip /path/to/ngrok.zip (Linux in Command prompt)
  
now open the directory RasaProject in Command prompt/Command line
now using the command ls(for Linux) and dir (for Windows), check if u can find ngrok.exe file

the file should be present in your RasaProject folder, if it is then
ngrok http 5005   
^ command could open up a channel that we would be using further for connecting Twilio with out Bot.
